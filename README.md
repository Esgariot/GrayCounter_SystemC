# GrayCounter_SystemC

A work in progress rewrite of GrayCounter in vhdl into systemC.

## HOW TO

- You need a `<systemc.h>` that compiler knows about (somewhere in includes)
- Also GTKWAVE

`$ make` to produce executable `Gray.out` which should make a .vcd when run (of course after we implement it)
`$ make clean` to clean

## TODO

- [ ] testbench
- [ ] sc_main
- [ ] clocks
- [ ] sensitivity list

## ABOUT

I included couple of useful resources (*.pdf and *.htm)
